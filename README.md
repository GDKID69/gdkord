## GDKORD
*Ok fair warning that this theme does lag quite a bit, I'm assuming it's because of all the glow effects*

Anyhow if you wanna use it with BetterDiscord or something just put this in your code<br/>
```css
@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GDKID69/gdkord/main/core/gdkord.css");
```
